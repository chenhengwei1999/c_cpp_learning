# 1.1 How to write a C++ Program

This is a simple C++ program.

```CPP
#include "iostream"
#include "string"

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    /*
    Our program will be placed here.
    */
    return 0;
}
```

## Main function

Every C++ program starts its execution from a function named `main`, and its general format is shown above. In this context, `int` is a keyword in the C++ programming language. It's important to note that main is not a C++ keyword itself, but when compiling a C++ program, the compiler assumes that there is a main function defined. If it's not defined, the program will not execute.

A function is a distinct sequence of program code consisting of four parts: the return type, the function name, the parameter list, and the function body. The body of the function is enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

## Header file and program code file

The definition of a class in C++ generally consists of two parts, usually written in separate files. One of them is the so-called `header file`, which declares various operations provided by the class. The other file, the `program txt`, contains the implementation details of these operations.

To use a `class`, we must include its header file in the program. The header file informs the program about the definition of the class. The C++ standard library for input and output is named `iostream`, which supports input and output operations to and from the terminal and files.

## Namespace

In C++ programming, a `namespace` is a mechanism used to organize code and identifiers (such as variables, functions, classes, etc.). It allows developers to define the same names for identifiers in different namespace, preventing naming conflicts and confusion.

A namespace can be thought of as a container that encapsulates related code and identifiers, allowing for better organization and management of code. By placing code within namespace, you can ensure that different parts of the code don't interfere with each other.

The main advantages of namespace include:

- Avoiding Naming Conflicts: When multiple developers are writing code in a large project, there might be situations where different parts of the code use the same names. By placing this code in separate namespace, conflicts can be avoided.

- Code Organization: namespace allow you to group related logical code together, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the code. This is particularly important in large projects.

- Modular Design: namespace enable developers to partition the code into logically distinct modules, each of which can reside in a different namespace, making the logical structure of the code clearer.

In C++, you can create namespace using the namespace keyword, like this:

```CPP
namespace MyNamespace {
    // Code and identifiers within the namespace
    int myFunction() {
        return 42;
    }
    
    class MyClass {
        // Class definition
    };
}
```

Then, you can use the identifiers within the namespace like this:

```CPP
int main() {
    int result = MyNamespace::myFunction();
    MyNamespace::MyClass obj;
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

This way, namespaces provide an effective way to organize and manage code, avoid naming conflicts, and promote modular code design.
